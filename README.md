# üì¶ Compiling

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install the necessary dependent packages
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip lib32z1 lib32z1-dev lib32stdc++6 libstdc++6 libncurses-dev u-boot-tools mkbootimg bc -y
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the project and change directory
git clone git@github.com:PhearZero/zero-pi-2.git
cd zero-pi-2

# Configure buildroot for your system
./zpi.sh init

# Make sure Python3 is not installed in the buildroot menu. The path is:
# Target Packages > Interpreter languages and scripting > python3
# Opening the menu by running:
./zpi.sh menu

# Finally run a full build for the system, this only has to be done once
# Can optionally pass in a VERSION, by default it is stored in the VERSION file
./zpi.sh build # Make sure the final image has a valid MBR, it will be near the end of the output
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Update Existing Build
```bash
# Once the project is built, it will have already run mkfw once.
# After changes are made, the project can be rebuilt much faster using
./zpi.sh mkfw
```

## Windows Tips:
- Install [Ubuntu WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) from the app store
- Remove the windows path from WSL to use built in toolchains and remove spaces from path
- Clone the repository after removing windows path to ensure line file endings are LF

Example `/etc/wsl.conf` for the Ubuntu WSL instance:
```
[interop]
appendWindowsPath = false
```
